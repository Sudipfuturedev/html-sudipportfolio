  <h1>Introduction to HTML,CSS & JavaScript</h1>
  <h2>HTML</h2>
  <img src="/images/html.png" height="50"/>

  <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language for structuring and describing the content of
    web pages. It's made up of elements and attributes that tell the browser how to display content and give meaning to
    pieces of text. For example, HTML elements can label content as a heading, paragraph, or link, and can structure
    documents into sections like headers, columns, or navigation menus. HTML can also be used to embed content like
    images and videos into a page</p>
  <h2>CSS</h2>

  <P>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including
    colours, layout, and fonts, thus making our web pages presentable to the users.

    CSS is designed to make style sheets for the web. It is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based
    markup language. Now letâ€™s try to break the acronym:
  <ul>
    <li>Cascading: Falling of Styles</li>
    <li>Style: Adding designs/Styling our HTML tags</li>
    <li>Sheets: Writing our style in different documents</li>
  </ul>
  </P>
  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <img src="/images/javascript.png" height="50"/>
  <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that is used to create and manage dynamic web pages, basically anything that
    moves on your screen without requiring you to refresh your browser. It can be anything from animated graphics to an
    automatically generated Facebook timeline. </p>

  <p>When most people get interested in web development, they start with good old HTML and CSS. From there, they move on
    to JavaScript, which makes sense, because, these three elements together form the backbone of web development.</p>
